C++ Program to Swap Two Numbers
This example contains two different techniques to swap numbers in C programming.
The first program uses temporary variable to swap numbers, whereas the second program doesn't use temporary variables.

int main()
{
  int a=5,b=10,temp;
  
  cout<<"The numbers swapped";
  temp=a;
  a=b;
  b=temp;
  
  cout<<"a="<<a<<"b="<<b<<endl;
  
  return 0;
}
