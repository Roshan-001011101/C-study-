C++ Program to Find Quotient and Remainder

To compute quotient and remainder, both divisor and dividend should be integers.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{    
    int i,j, quotient, remainder;

    cout << "Enter dividend: ";
    cin >> i;

    cout << "Enter divisor: ";
    cin >> j;

    quotient = i/ j;
    remainder = i % j;

    cout << "Quotient = " << quotient << endl;
    cout << "Remainder = " << remainder;

    return 0;
}
